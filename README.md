# zod-endpoints-example

Example project for [zod-endpoints](https://github.com/flock-community/zod-endpoints)


# Notes:

Use cases that we'll test here:

 * [x] tests will generate a openapi schema json 
 * [x] run `yarn generate-api` to generate an example rtx-queries api stub
 * [ ] use openapi to start a  mock server e.g. [prism](https://stoplight.io/open-source/prism/)
 * [ ] start a dummy frontend that fetches data from some api routes on the mock server
